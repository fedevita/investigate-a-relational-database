In general, Stephens Jon tends to contribute significantly more to sales compared to the rest of the staff. Notably, in the month of May, the gap in his favor is greater compared to other months.

-- Q2 - IS IT POSSIBLE TO OPTIMIZE THE FILM INVENTORY?
/*
4.2% of the films do not have excess copies but have not had any rentals and are not in the inventory. I suggest updating the film list to remove them.

76.10% of the films have one more copy than the historical maximum of concurrent rentals. This is considered the standard and ensures an additional copy in case of unusual demand.

The remaining 19.70% of the films have 2 or more copies in excess compared to the historical maximum of concurrent rentals. Here, it might be possible to optimize by selling the excess copies, thus reducing storage costs or potential waste in future purchases of unnecessary copies.

-- Q3 - HOW IS THE DAILY PAYMENT TREND COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS DAY DIVIDED BY MOVIE RATING?
/*
Analyzing the graph, it is possible to notice a very inconsistent trend. It is evident from the graph that within the sample
there is a possible pattern characterized by a significant drop in sales of about 90% regardless of the movie rating, followed by
considerable sales peaks reaching increases in the order of 700% compared to the previous day.
